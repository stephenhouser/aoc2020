# Day 22: Crab Combat

Basic iteration and recursion and a little cache (dynamic programming)

## Part 1

Parse the decks into `deque` and simulate the hands as described. Nothing funny.

## Part 2

WTF is the problem even wanting me to to. Having a hard time understanding the
problem statement. Looks like basic recursion with a base case, just a bit
tricky for when it terminates. Nothing special.

Used a hash function (`state_hash`) to cache states and avoid repeated states.
This could be useful in other problems.
