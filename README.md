Contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

Tools:

- C++ 23 (STL only)
- Visual Studio Code
- macOS / Linux (primary)
- git

## Running

There is a top level makefile that can be used to make each day or a `summary`

- `make day5` will make day5 and test against the live `input.txt` in that directory.
- `make summary` will make all days and run against the `test.txt` and `input.txt` in each directory.

When developing, within each day's directory.

- `make` or `make test` will build and run `test.txt` which is sample input from the problem
- `make input` will build and run `input.txt` which is the live input for the problem

To debug, change the `Makefile`, remove `-O3` and replace with `-g`. Then use GDB
or modify the launch configuration in `.vscode/launch.json` for the appropriate day and input file.
